/**
 * Shows how methods can be included and excluded from a spec run. For
 * demonstration purposes, the configuration script's location is set
 * programmatically in a static initializer. Usually, the configuration
 * script's location would be set externally (via the same system property),
 * or the configuration script would reside in one of the two default locations:
 * <li>
 * <ul><tt>SpockConfig.groovy</tt> on the class path</ul>
 * <ul><tt>$user_home/.spock/SpockConfig.groovy</tt> on the file system</ul>
 * </li>
 *
 * <p>Note that the configuration script referenced by the system property
 * may either reside on the class path or on the file system (make sure to
 * include the whole path).
 *
 * <p>What's not shown here is that filtering also works for classes.
 * Whereas methods can only be filtered based on annotations, classes can
 * also be filtered based on their base class.
 *
 * <p>If you directly want to see the effect of different Spock configurations,
 * just run this spec from your IDE with an additional VM parameter
 * <li>
 * <ul><tt>-Dspock.configuration=IncludeFastConfig.groovy</tt> or</ul>
 * <ul><tt>-Dspock.configuration=ExcludeSlowConfig.groovy</tt></ul>
 * </li>
 *
 * <p>See also the two corresponding resource files provided with this spec.
